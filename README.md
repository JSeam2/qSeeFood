# qSeeFood

## Motivations
This is inspired by the Silicon Valley series fracas, See Food. Now we're tryingto create a quantum version of the binary classification algorithm.

## Quickstart
To use the notebook you will need to create a `secret.py` file containing the following content.

```
# in secret.py

TOKEN = '<INSERT IBM Q EXPERIENCE TOKEN HERE>'
```

Next you will need to install the dependencies and you should be able to run the notebook. You might want to use a virtual environment for this. If you are experiencing problems with tensorflow installation you should use anaconda.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
